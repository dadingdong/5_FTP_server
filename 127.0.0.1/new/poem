'Gilgamesh, where are you hurrying?
You will not find that life that you purusue.
When the gods created mankind,
They allotted to him death,
But life they retained in their own keeping.
As for you, Gilgamesh, fill your belly with good things,
Make thou merry by day and by night.
Of each day make thou a feast of rejoicing,
Day and night dance and play!
Let your clothing be sparkling fresh,
Thy head be washed; bathe thou in water.
Love the child that holds on to thy hand,
Make your wife happy in your embrace!
For this is the lot of mankind!'
